# Godisk

Godisk is a simple, clean utility to view disk usage and other related info for Unix or GNU/Linux. It is written in Go.
I didn't like the output of `du`, `gdu`, or `df` so I wrote this. I can't seem to get any of these utilities
to line up perfectly, but all of them are close.

## Installation

```
go install github.com/tom773/godisk@latest
```

## Usage

```
godisk
```
There's (currently) no flags or options. Keeping it simple.
